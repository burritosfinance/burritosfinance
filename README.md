INTRODUCTION :
BURRITOS FINANCE
inspired by delicious food burritos in Mexico.
Burritos Finance is creating infrastructure to unlock the multi-layer, and multi-chain future of Ethereum, and other layer 1 blockchains. At present, the lack of compatibility between blockchains and layers results in disparity and inefficiency. Developers are very restricted in what they can build with siloed infrastructures, and users are forced to navigate complicated and lengthy processes if they want to utilize multiple chains or layers.
We are a team of developers with experience in DeFi applications. Currently, we have 2 other web designers and a Polygon Matic expert to ensure the project will be executed smoothly.
Our focus is on supporting the multi-layer, multi-chain future of DeFi.
DeFi protocols of all sorts (including huge players like Uniswap, Binance smart chain, and Polygon) are starting to deploy onto distinct layers (Ethereum, Okexchain, Polygon and Binance smart chain ). We are at the frontline of making this transition easier, as we build the infrastructure to navigate these new spaces. We expect to roll out our first features in the next few months.
